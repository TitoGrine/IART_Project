class sklearn.svm.SVC(*, C=1.0, kernel='rbf', degree=3, gamma='scale',
 coef0=0.0, shrinking=True, probability=False, tol=0.001, cache_size=200,
  class_weight=None, verbose=False, max_iter=-1,
   decision_function_shape='ovr', break_ties=False, random_state=None)

basic_pipeline: hovers around .5
                C -> up for better?
                kernel -> linear hovers .52, sigmoid is kinda wild, precomputed not supported, 
                degree -> only for poly kernel, worthless
                gamma -> weird? can be a float?
                coef0 -> only for poly and sigmoid, improves with higher values
                shrinking -> keep it on ffs
                probability -> ??? worsens?
                tol -> didn't change much
                cache_size -> probably better to up it
                max_iter -> why would i limit, huh
                decision_function_shape -> ovo might be marginally better (turns out it's not)
                break_ties -> idk man (True makes it marginally worse?)

stemming_pipeline: meh

stopwords_pipeline: better?

emojis_pipeline: meh

everything_pipeline: seems better
