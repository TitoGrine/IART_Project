sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB(alpha=1.0, fit_prior=True, class_prior=None)

basic_pipeline: incon-fuckin-clusive
                hovers around .5, kinda under

emojis_pipeline: slight improvement with fit_prior=False(?)
                 hovers around .5

stemming_pipeline: better than those two?
                   hovers around .55?
                   no smoothing improves a little(?)

stopwords_pipeline: hovers around.5, kinda above?
                    inconclusive all around

everything_pipeline: somehow lame as shit, hardly goes past .5 ever
                     higher alpha makes it *worse* (cut that)
                     fit_prior=False makes it very slightly better(?) (it's noooot)

conclusion: what the fuck i'm confused
