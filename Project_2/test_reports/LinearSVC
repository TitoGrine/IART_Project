class sklearn.svm.LinearSVC(penalty='l2', loss='squared_hinge',
 *, dual=True, tol=0.0001, C=1.0, multi_class='ovr',
  fit_intercept=True, intercept_scaling=1, class_weight=None,
   verbose=0, random_state=None, max_iter=1000)

basic_pipeline: hovers around .55
                loss -> squared_hinge marginally better
                dual -> false marginally better (i was wrong)
                tol -> increasing seems to tighten result window
                C -> inconclusive
                multi_class -> crammer_singer is slower, doesn't do much
                fit_intercept -> inconclusive (keep on)
                intercept_scaling -> inconclusive (test further, increasing seems bad)
                class_weight -> idek anymore
                max_iter -> RELEVANT FINALLY

stemming_pipeline: not much of a diff

emojis_pipeline: again

stopwords_pipeline: just straight up chaos

everything_pipeline: it's..... worse? why is it worse? WHY
