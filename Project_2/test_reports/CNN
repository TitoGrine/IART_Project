classifiers.cnn.CNN((dropout_rate=0.2, filters=250,
                 kernel_size=3, units=250, activation_conv='relu',
                 activation_end='sigmoid',

dropout_rate -> seems to have a sweet spot around .42 - .44
filters -> more than 500 seems to make it worse
kernel_size -> i refuse to keep increasing it
units -> similar situation to filters
(skippin bois)
epochs -> more epochs gets better results with diminishing returns (unsurprisingly)
